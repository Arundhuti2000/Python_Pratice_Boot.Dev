## üìã Project Overview
The project's primary purpose is to provide a simple implementation of the "Remove Duplicates" problem. The goal of this problem is to remove all duplicates from an unsorted list of numbers, while preserving the order of the remaining elements. The main component `main.py` provides a simple and efficient solution to this problem by using a dictionary to keep track of the unique numbers in the input list.
The main objectives of this project are:
* Provide a simple implementation of the "Remove Duplicates" problem
* Use a dictionary to keep track of the unique numbers in the input list, which allows for efficient removal of duplicates
* Test the functionality of the `remove_duplicates` function by using the `main_test.py` file as a test harness

## üíª Tech Stack
The primary technologies used in this project are:
* Python: The main language used for implementation and testing is Python. Python is an easy-to-learn, high-level language that provides a rich set of libraries and frameworks for implementing various algorithms and data structures.
* Unittest: Unittest is a Python package used for writing unit tests. It allows developers to write automated tests for their code and ensures that the functionality of their code remains intact over time.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture
The project has a simple and modular structure, with a clear separation between the main component and its dependencies. The main component is `main.py`, which serves as the entry point for the application. The `remove_duplicates` function is defined in this file, and it takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of unique numbers.
The project's architecture can be described as a hybrid between a monolithic and microservices approach. On one hand, the main component is a standalone application that can be executed directly by the user. On the other hand, the `main_test.py` file serves as a test harness for the `remove_duplicates` function, which makes it easy to test the functionality of the function without having to execute the entire application.

## üß© Key Components
The main component `main.py` defines a simple function `remove_duplicates`, which takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of unique numbers. The `run_cases` variable contains test cases that can be used to test the functionality of the function. The `submit_cases` variable contains additional test cases that are provided by the user for submission.
The `main_test.py` file defines a `test` function that takes two arguments: `input1` and `expected_output`. This function uses the `remove_duplicates` function to remove duplicates from the input list, and then checks whether the resulting output matches the expected output provided by the user.
The main objectives of this component are:
* Define a simple function for removing duplicates from a list of numbers
* Test the functionality of the `remove_duplicates` function using test cases

## üîÄ Implementation Flow
The high-level workflow of the project's implementation can be described as follows:
* The user inputs a list of numbers and calls the `remove_duplicates` function with this input list as an argument
* The `remove_duplicates` function creates a dictionary to keep track of the unique numbers in the input list
* The function iterates over the input list, adding each number to the dictionary if it is not already present
* Once all elements have been processed, the function returns the keys of the dictionary, which correspond to the unique numbers in the input list
* The resulting output is then printed by the user

## üöÄ Future Improvements
There are several potential enhancements that could be made to this project's architecture or functionality. Some potential areas for optimization or scaling include:
* Using a more efficient data structure than a dictionary to keep track of unique numbers, such as a hash table or a sorted array
* Parallelizing the implementation of the `remove_duplicates` function using multi-threading or multi-processing techniques
* Adding additional functionality, such as support for multiple input formats or output formats, or additional test cases that cover more complex scenarios.
